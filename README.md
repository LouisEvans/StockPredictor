# StockPredictor
A program for EngineersGate Challenge with Exeter University. The program used a given API to access a simulated stock market, and competed to predict the next epoch's (1 minute) market prices for 500 companies. We competed with our algorithm for 24 hours against ~8 teams and won overall. Our algorithm took into account the general trend (over entire dataset), the last 5 epochs weighted exponentially, as well as the spikes and troughs.
